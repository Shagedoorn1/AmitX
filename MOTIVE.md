# This is AmitX

AmitX is an operating system.
But it's also not.

It's not just code. Not just a shell, kernel or compiler with a ridiculous mascot.
AmitX is what happens when someone refuses to disappear.

I'm Amity. I'm a girl, some would call me a trans girl. And this is the loudest way I know to say:
**I am real. I am here. And I will not be erased**

## Why I made AmitX

The worls hasn't always given me the space or freedom to exist.
At home, in school, in therapy - I've been told I'm not who I say I am.
I've lived through things no one should, hurt by the people I trusted the most.

So I built a system that listens. That compiles. That hoots.
I created something that reflects me *because i needed to*.
Because nothing, or no-one else did.

AmitX is caffeine and chaos. It's puns and purpose. It's function declarations and identity declarations.
It's an OS stitched together from sleepless nights and determination.
It's what happens when grief meets a keyboard and decides to turn pain into punchlines.

## What it means

Every part of AmitX is personal:
- **Owly**, the language and compiler (OwlyC): She's my revenge. My creation. A semi-sentient owl born from rage at an interpreter and love for low-level precision.
- **The shell**: A tiny space where *my* words finally matter.
- **The whole system**: A mirror. A message. A place I belong - because I made it that way

AmitX might be messy. It might be ridiculous.
But it's real - because I am.

And if you're reading this, and you're different or hurting or building something that feels too big or strange:
Let AmitX be proof that you *can*.
Let Owly hoot for you too

## tl;dr
AmitX is more than an OS.
It's my story in code
And it hoots louder than words can.
