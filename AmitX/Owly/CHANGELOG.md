# CHANGELOG.md

## [0.0.1] ‚Äî *‚ÄúThe Owl Is Born‚Äù*  
*Release date: 2025-06-12*  

Behold, from the haunted depths of cursed syntax and C-induced sleep deprivation, **Owly** emerges.  
Feathers are still wet. Sanity? Questionable. But it compiles.

---

### Added

- **The Sacred Ritual (`func main()`)**
  - Owly now understands where code begins. Praise be the void, and pass the file descriptor.

- **`print()` statement support**
  - Strings? Printed.  
  - Integers? Screeched into the void.  
  - Lists? Beautiful arrays of nonsense, spat out like regurgitated pellets.

- **Variable Declarations**
  - `int` and `char` now exist. They do nothing special. They just are. Like owls in a tree.
  - `list` of strings (`const char*[]`) now supported. Technically a `const char*` rave.

- **Flow Control**
  - `if`: Decides.  
  - `else if`: Keeps deciding.  
  - `else`: Gives up and runs whatever‚Äôs left.  
  - All brackets placed gently where C expects them, lest we anger the compiler demon.

- **`while` Loops**
  - Owly now loops until it dies or breaks out ‚Äî just like developers.

- **Output: C Code**
  - Automatically wraps your hoots in a proper C `main()` with `#include <stdio.h>`.
  - Owly doesn't indent code; it caresses it into shape with precision tabs and guilt.

---

### Internals

- Keeps track of open blocks like it‚Äôs herding owl eggs.
- `list_vars[]` stores known lists to ensure we treat them with special love and printf hacks.
- Everything assumes the input is valid. If it isn't? It‚Äôs your problem now. ü™¶

---

### Known Nightmares

- No support for user-defined functions yet. Owly is still too young to recurse.
- No `for` loops yet. Those are for mature birds.
- Errors are not errors ‚Äî they‚Äôre prophecies in disguise. Expect segmentation faults if you anger it.

---

### Philosophy

Owly isn't just a language. It‚Äôs a *lifestyle*.  
You don't write Owly code. You **whisper it** into the compiler and pray the spirit of Dennis Ritchie doesn‚Äôt smite you.  
Future versions will feature:  
- `hoot()` for expressive printing  
- `owl()` for mystical error messages  
- And maybe a standard library if we survive.

## [0.1.0] ‚Äî *‚ÄúThe Owl Is Grown‚Äù*  
*Release date: 2025-06-14* 

---
### Added
- **function declaration**
  - Easy to do, `func your_func_name() {}`
  - The owl is quite lazy, she only supports void functions
  - Owly prefers it if you define your function before using it in the main. Your code will still work, she'll just be a bit annoyed. Expect screetches (warnings)
- **for loops**
  - Yes, C style, for the python users reading this: haha, good luck!
  - But seriously, use for (int i = [start]; i < [stop]; i = i + 1) {} or whatever suits your mood
  - Owly is not a fan of snakes so python style for loops are not supported. Maybe in the future she'll be open to it
  - pyfor or forin maybe in the future?
