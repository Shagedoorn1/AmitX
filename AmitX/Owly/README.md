# Owly

> The one true hoot-compiler. Written in C. Forged in frustration. Runs on caffeine and spite.

Welcome to **Owly**, a compiled programming language designed to hoot at your enemies and occasionally execute code.

Owly was born because interpreted languages take *forever* to run and compiling to C is the universal cheat code. You write `Owly`, it becomes C, and then C does the heavy lifting like the good old days.

Owly is part of the [AmitX Operating System], the world's most ambitious OS developed by a girl as nocturnal as the demons she creates.

## ü™µ Features (yes, this bird has them)

- Integer arithmetic (add, subtract, divide, hoot into the void)
- Strings, because you gotta say stuff
- Lists, because arrays were too mainstream
- List indexing (finally, *something* zero-based)
- `print()` and `hoot()` are the same thing. Choose your vibe.
- Wrapped in a `main()` like civilized languages are
- Compiles to C because that's what gods and compilers do

## How to Run Owly (if you must)

Make sure you‚Äôre in a Unix-like environment with `gcc`. Then run:

```bash
chmod +x owlyrun.sh
./owlyrun.sh test.owly
```
## warning!!
This might cause the hooter to get mad at you.
